hasql
=====

``hasql`` is a library for high available PostgreSQL clusters.

Library for acquiring actual connections with masters and replicas.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiokitchen/hasql/master/resources/diagram.svg

Features
========

* completely asynchronous api
* automatic detection of the host role in the cluster
* health-checks for each host and automatic traffic outage for
  unavailable hosts
* autodetection of hosts role changes, in case replica
  host will be promoted to master
* different policies for load balancing
* support ``asyncpg``, ``psycopg3`` and ``aiopg``


Usage
=====

Some useful examples

Creating connection pool
************************

When acquiring a connection, the connection object of the used driver is
returned (``aiopg.connection.Connection`` for **aiog** and
`asyncpg.pool.PoolConnectionProxy` for **asyncpg** and **asyncpgsa**)


Database URL specirication rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Multiple hosts should be passed comma separated

  * multihost example:

    * ``postgresql://db1,db2,db3/``
  * split result:

    * ``postgresql://db1:5432/``
    * ``postgresql://db1:5432/``
    * ``postgresql://db1:5432/``
* The non-default port for each host might be passed after hostnames. e.g.

  * multihost example:

    * ``postgresql://db1:1234,db2:5678,db3/``
  * split result:

    * ``postgresql://db1:1234/``
    * ``postgresql://db1:5678/``
    * ``postgresql://db1:5432/``
* The special case for non-default port for all hosts

  * multihost example:

    * ``postgresql://db1,db2,db3:6432/``
  * split result:

    * ``postgresql://db1:6432/``
    * ``postgresql://db1:6432/``
    * ``postgresql://db1:6432/``


For ``aiopg`` or ``aiopg.sa``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**aiopg** must be installed as a requirement.

Code example using ``aiopg``:

.. code-block:: python

    from hasql.aiopg import PoolManager

    hosts = ",".join([
        "master-host:5432",
        "replica-host-1:5432",
        "replica-host-2:5432",
    ])

    multihost_dsn = f"postgresql://user:password@{hosts}/dbname"

    async def create_pool(dsn) -> PoolManager:
        pool = PoolManager(multihost_dsn)

        # Waiting for 1 master and 1 replica will be available
        await pool_manager.ready(masters_count=1, replicas_count=1)
        return pool

    ])

    multihost_dsn = f"postgresql://user:password@{hosts}/dbname"

    async def create_pool(dsn) -> PoolManager:
        pool = PoolManager(multihost_dsn)

        # Waiting for 1 master and 1 replica will be available
        await pool_manager.ready(masters_count=1, replicas_count=1)
        return pool

For ``asyncpg``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**asyncpg** must be installed as a requirement

.. code-block:: python

        "replica-host-2:5432",
    ])

    multihost_dsn = f"postgresql://user:password@{hosts}/dbname"

    async def create_pool(dsn) -> PoolManager:
        pool = PoolManager(multihost_dsn)

        # Waiting for 1 master and 1 replica will be available
        await pool_manager.ready(masters_count=1, replicas_count=1)
        return pool

For ``asyncpgsa``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**asyncpgsa** must be installed as a requirement

.. code-block:: python

    from hasql.asyncpgsa import PoolManager

    hosts = ",".join([
        "master-host:5432",
        "replica-host-1:5432",
        "replica-host-2:5432",
    ])

    multihost_dsn = f"postgresql://user:password@{hosts}/dbname"

    async def create_pool(dsn) -> PoolManager:
        pool = PoolManager(multihost_dsn)

        # Waiting for 1 master and 1 replica will be available
        await asyncio.gather(
            pool_manager.wait_masters_ready(1),

        # Waiting for 1 master and 1 replica will be available
        await pool_manager.ready(masters_count=1, replicas_count=1)
        return pool


Acquiring connections
*********************

Connections should be acquired with async context manager:

Acquiring master connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    async def do_something():
        pool = await create_pool(multihost_dsn)
        async with pool.acquire(read_only=False) as connection:
            ...

or

.. code-block:: python

    async def do_something():
        pool = await create_pool(multihost_dsn)
        async with pool.acquire_master() as connection:
            ...

Acquiring replica connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    async def do_something():
        pool = await create_pool(multihost_dsn)
        async with pool.acquire(read_only=True) as connection:
            ...

or

.. code-block:: python

    async def do_something():
        pool = await create_pool(multihost_dsn)
        async with pool.acquire_replica() as connection:
            ...

Without context manager (really not recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    async def do_something():
        pool = await create_pool(multihost_dsn)
        connection = await pool.acquire(read_only=False)
        await pool.release(connection)

or more useful

.. code-block:: python

    async def do_something():
        pool = await create_pool(multihost_dsn)
        try:
            connection = await pool.acquire(read_only=False)
        finally:
            await pool.release(connection)

How it works?
=============

For each host from dsn string, a connection pool is created. From each pool one
connection is reserved, which is used to check the availability of the host and
its role. The minimum and maximum number of connections in the pool increases
by 1 (to reserve a system connection).

For each pool a background task is created, in which the host availability and
its role (master or replica) is checked once every `refresh_delay` second.

When switching hosts roles, hasql detects this with a slight delay.

For PostgreSQL, when switching the master, all connections to all hosts are
broken (the details of implementing PostgreSQL).

If there are no available hosts, the methods acquire(), acquire_master(), and
acquire_replica() wait until the host with the desired role startup.
