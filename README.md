Some useful examples

### Creating connection pool

When acquiring a connection, the connection object of the used driver is 
returned (`aiopg.connection.Connection` for **aiog** and 
`asyncpg.pool.PoolConnectionProxy` for **asyncpg** and **asyncpgsa**)

#### For aiopg or aiopg.sa:

**aiopg** must be installed as a requirement

```python
from hasql.aiopg import PoolManager

multihost_dsn = "postgresql://user:password@master-host:5432,replica-host-1:5432,replica-host-2:5432/dbname"
pool = PoolManager(multihost_dsn)
```

or

```python
from hasql.aiopg_sa import PoolManager

multihost_dsn = "postgresql://user:password@master-host:5432,replica-host-1:5432,replica-host-2:5432/dbname"
pool = PoolManager(multihost_dsn)
```

#### For asyncpg:

**asyncpg** must be installed as a requirement

```python
from hasql.asyncpg import PoolManager

multihost_dsn = "postgresql://user:password@master-host:5432,replica-host-1:5432,replica-host-2:5432/dbname"
pool = PoolManager(multihost_dsn)
```

#### For asyncpgsa:

**asyncpgsa** must be installed as a requirement

```python
from hasql.asyncpgsa import PoolManager

multihost_dsn = "postgresql://user:password@master-host:5432,replica-host-1:5432,replica-host-2:5432/dbname"
pool = PoolManager(multihost_dsn)
```

#### For psycopg3:

**psycopg3** must be installed as a requirement (package name is `psycopg`)

```python
from hasql.psycopg3 import PoolManager

multihost_dsn = "postgresql://user:password@master-host:5432,replica-host-1:5432,replica-host-2:5432/dbname"
pool = PoolManager(multihost_dsn)
```


### Acquiring connections

Connections should be acquired with async context manager: 

#### Acquiring master connection

```python

async def do_something():
    async with pool.acquire(read_only=False) as connection:
        ...

```

or

```python
async def do_something():
    async with pool.acquire_master() as connection:
        ...
```

##### Acquiring replica connection

```python
async def do_something():
    async with pool.acquire(read_only=True) as connection:
        ...
```

or

```python
async def do_something():
    async with pool.acquire_replica() as connection:
        ...
```

##### Without context manager (not recommended)

```python
async def do_something():
    connection = await pool.acquire(read_only=False)
    await pool.release(connection)
```

or more useful 

```python
async def do_something():
    try:
        connection = await pool.acquire(read_only=False)
    finally:
        await pool.release(connection)
```

How it works?
=============

For each host from dsn string, a connection pool is created. From each pool one connection is reserved, which is used to check the availability of the host and its role. The minimum and maximum number of connections in the pool increases by 1 (to reserve a system connection).

For each pool a background task is created, in which the host availability and its role (master or replica) is checked once every `refresh_delay` second.

When switching hosts roles, hasql detects this with a slight delay.

For PostgreSQL, when switching the master, all connections to all hosts are broken (the details of implementing PostgreSQL).

If there are no available hosts, the methods acquire(), acquire_master(), and acquire_replica() wait until the host with the desired role startup.
